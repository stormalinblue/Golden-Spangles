# Golden Spangles 

A salt analysis program

Using a special code via the prompt, find out the chemical name of the unknown salt

TO DO:

1. Use some kick ass chemistry rather than hardcoding

2. Ability to go free range 

3. Perhaps use graphics and stuff to actually show the reactions and everything, but idle is more troll
